## What is NyckHub?
> NyckHub is an organized multiple media platform combiner with many additional features like Discord RichPresence, Frameless, etc. written with ElectronJS.

## What should I expect?
Currently: Not much
### Why?
NyckHub is currently in Alpha-Mode. Not every pre-planned feature is included or working right now (like Capture- and Party Mode). The interface of the "hub" (the main page) is not completed yet and there are many fun features planned for the hub/lobby which are currently <s>top</s> secret ðŸ¤«.

## But.. how do I install it?
The Linux and Windows executables are already pre-compiled (Windows gets compiled by myself and the Linux ones over my Debian 10 Server).
You can find both in the newest [releases](https://www.github.com/RealzWolfy/NyckHub/releases).
If you want to build the project yourself, do this:

1. You need to have [NodeJS](https://www.nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Download/Clone this repository (if you have a Git CLI, open your terminal/console, type in: `git clone https://www.github.com/RealzWolfy/NyckHub.git` and hit enter.).
3. Unzip the archive.
4. CD into the extracted folder (Open your terminal/console and type in: `cd /path/to/NyckHub/`).
5. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
6. Now you're able to start the program with `electron .` .
7. If you want to build the program, type in: `npm run dist`.
